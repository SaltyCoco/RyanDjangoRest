# Files
You will notice a missing directories.  TI did not include them because I doubt you care about the autogenerate files.  I usually use the Django add on for PyCharm to create the base template.  If that is not available I just use the cli tool.  For all my projects I prefer to create a venv environment.  It takes up space on a local machine but is much better in terms of deployment.

# Deploymemt
Speaking of deployment, my prefered method is aws.  If it is just a quick job using elastic beanstalk is my usual MO due to the fact that it does most the work for you.  I always connect it to a rds postgres or ssms so I do not have to manage the db.  If it is a json DyanmoDB or MongoDB (i.e no sql) I switch to tornado or flask.

# Front-End
I make no claims about being good at making pretty websites.  I can / have created the front end as well using bootstrap, javascript (JQuery.js, Backbone.js and / or react.js), html5.  That being said javascript is the bane of my programming exsistance but after speaking with your counter parts a working knowledge of it will suffice.  Therefore, this example is just giving a more back end view.

# rds postgres
If you would like me to I can fire up a postgres, ssms, DynamoDB or mongoDB and give you access if you don't mind providing the IP you would connect from.  You can give me a general idea of what would be stored and I can do it.  I have a few personal dbs running, however, they are production for an iOS and android app I released.  I can show you via screen share if you would like.  Just know that I do know how to create and automate the dataflows for a db.
